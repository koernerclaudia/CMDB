# cMDb (Claudia's Movie Database)

(this project and this readme file are still WIP)

## WIP: 

This is my verison of a movie database set up during my Web Dev Training with CareerFoundry. The task was to build 

- a backend with MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.JS and Express
- a frontend using React
- (-> MERN Stack)

Status: 27 July 2024

- I have just done the data modelling via the Mongoose Model file and set up a few endpoints and tested those in Postman.
- Users will be able to change their profile and collect a list of favourite movies.

More info coming soon...
