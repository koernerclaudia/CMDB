# cMDb (Claudia's Movie Database)

WIP - API documentation on Swagger, currently can be seen here: 
https://cmdb-b8f3cd58963f.herokuapp.com/documentation.html

## Purpose

This is my version of a backend of a movie database; set up during my Full Stack Web Dev Training with [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). 
The project is built on the MERN Stack -> MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js.

The project is supposed to demonstrate full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs (REST), web server
frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication, data security, and more.

This project consists of 2 parts:

PART1 = Backend built with MongoDB, Express & Node.js.

PART2 = Frontend built with React - [Check it out here](https://github.com/koernerclaudia/CMDB-Live)

## Built & Technologies

A backend was created with
- Web Server Environment: Node.js & Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Database Modelling (ODM): Mongoose
- Node Modules & Packages:
    - ...
- Middleware
- Libraries

## Content & Functionalities

The Database consists of 2 collections:
- Movies
- Users

Users will be able to
- set up an account and get authenticated (username, password, email info will be necessary)
- Log in and out
- Change their user information
- Set up a list of favourite movies, add & delete movies from it
- De-register / Delete their account

The information about movies will include title, description, main actors, genre, genre info, director and year of birth of the director.
